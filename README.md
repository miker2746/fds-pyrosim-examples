## FDS runtime environment to run multiple meshes using Open MPI - Ubuntu 14.04 x64 LTS
FDS 6.3.X requires Open MPI 1.8.4 to run in parallel mode. NIST provides [information about requirements](https://github.com/firemodels/fds-smv/wiki/Installing-and-Running-FDS-on-a-Linux-Cluster#running-with-mpi-distributed-memory-computing) as well as [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/firemodels/fds-smv/wiki/Installing-Open-MPI-on-a-Linux-Cluster#installing-open-mpi-from-pre-compiled-binaries).

Clone this repository. This repository ships with FDS 6.3.0 and pre-compiled OpenMPI 1.8.4. 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/saschagottfried/fds-pyrosim-examples
```

Extract pre-compiled archive in `dist` folder.

```
$ cd fds-pyrosim-examples
$ cd dist
$ tar -xvzf openmpi_1.8.4_linux_64.tar.gz
$ cd ..
```

Add FDS libraries in `bin` folder to shared libraries environment. Adjust absolute path to your environment.

```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=bin/LIB64
```

Increase stack size. Otherwise a larger FDS model runs into a segmentation fault.

```
$ ulimit -s unlimited
```

Limit number of OpenMP threads

```
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
```

Run the model with FDS 6.3.0

```
$ dist/openmpi_64/bin/mpiexec -np 4 bin/fds atrium_with_fans.fds 
 Mesh   1 is assigned to MPI Process   0
 Mesh   2 is assigned to MPI Process   1
 Mesh   3 is assigned to MPI Process   2
 Mesh   4 is assigned to MPI Process   3
 OpenMP thread   0 of   0 assigned to MPI process   0 of   3

## Run model with FDS 6.3.1
FDS 6.3.1 is a bit less verbose but shows useful information about MPI version in use.

Validate working Open MPI environment. This only works if you extract pre-compiled Open MPI to `/shared` folder. 

```
$ /shared/openmpi_64/bin/mpiexec -version
mpiexec (OpenRTE) 1.8.4
