## FDS environment to run multiple meshes using MPI
FDS 6.3.X requires Open MPI 1.8.4 to run in parallel mode.

Validate Open MPI environment 

```
$ /shared/openmpi_64/bin/mpiexec -version
nmpiexec (OpenRTE) 1.8.4

Report bugs to http://www.open-mpi.org/community/help/
```

Add FDS libraries to shared libraries environment

```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Downloads/fds-smv/6.3.0/bin/LIB64
```

Increase stack size. Otherwise a larger model runs into segmentation fault.

```
$ ulimit -s unlimited
```

Limit OpenMP threads for MPI execution

```
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
```

Run the model

```
$ /shared/openmpi_64/bin/mpiexec -np 4 ~/Downloads/fds-smv/6.3.0/bin/fds atrium_with_fans.fds 
 Mesh   1 is assigned to MPI Process   0
 Mesh   2 is assigned to MPI Process   1
 Mesh   3 is assigned to MPI Process   2
 Mesh   4 is assigned to MPI Process   3

## Run model with FDS 6.3.1
FDS 6.3.1 is a bit less verbose but shows useful information on MPI version and implementation.
